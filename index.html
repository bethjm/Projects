        <p id="whoparahome">I am a software engineer with a background in personal training and biomechanics. My core skills include JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, flexbox, and jQuery.</p>
        <p id="whoparahome">The application of biomechanics to personal training sparked my love for complex problem solving and inspiried me to puruse software engineering.</p>
        <p id="whoparahome">I am hoping that in the future I can progress into a project managment role. I believe that combining my problem solving and leadership skills will make me a valuable asset to any company's team.</p>

                <p class="whattexthome">Beth has the ability to make people feel heard. She is both empowering and patient with her approach to working with people. She is incredibly mindful and meets her clients where they are at. -Kelcie</p>
                <p class="whattexthome">Beth asked great questions with non-judgmental curiosity. She was professional, efficient and organized. She arrived on time and was always encouraging. She made conversation easily and really cared about me and my family. -Jess</p>
                <p class="whattexthome">I got placed with Beth by the luck of the draw. She teaches the what and why behind exercise, she never asks you to do anything blindly.  At some point you can probably go off on your own, but I can guarantee you won't want to. -Dylan</p>
                <p class="whattexthome">Although I was a little skeptical of someone so much younger than me, Beths enthusiasm and confidence made me give her a try. I discovered she really does know what she's doing!  -Ellen</p>
                <p class="whattexthome">My favourite part about my relationship with Beth is our communication. We have always found a way to come to a better understanding and in most cases grow closer and stronger together because of it. -Robey</p>
