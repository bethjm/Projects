unsolved problems:
The nav bar doesn't shrink properly for screens smaller than 500px. I added a scroll bar as a hacky fix. 

The 'contact beth' modal on the bio page for screens smaller than 500px doesnt display properly. I think the issue has something to do with flex box and/or the classes I used for my buttons. I added a scroll bar as a hacky fix.

I can't get photo and button to wrap with the text on the bio page. I figured it out on the home page and can't figure it out on the bio page.
