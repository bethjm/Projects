            <h4 class="biotitle">Hi, I'm Beth...</h4>
            <p class="biopara">I am a software engineer with a background in personal training and biomechanics. My core skills include JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and jQuery. I love hiking, cooking, and snuggling with my cats. I am most at peace in the mountains.</p>
            <h4 class="biotitle">Why the transition from training to software?</h4>
            <p class="biopara"> In my practice as a trainer I am hired to create a product. Example: someone may want to cycle 400 miles uphill in 5 days (yes, this is true). During my evaluation I look for ‘bugs’ in the system, something that might be interrupting fluid movement and causing a problem. </p>
            <p class="biopara"> I put together an exercise program to ‘debug’ the issues and pick the quickest and effective exercises. The exercises don't always work for a person's system, so I am adaptable in finding other solutions that acheive a similair result. After time, debugged, and patience- the client acheives the product they hired me for. (Can you see the similairities?)</p>
            <h4 class="biotitle">The perfect marraige of skills...</h4>
            <p class="biopara">I am excited that software engineering will lend to my love for complex systemic problem solving. I am hoping that in the future I can progress into a project managment role. I am very proud of my ability to push someone to the next level without pushing them over the edge. This is a skill I was able to forge during my personal training career. I believe that combining these two skills would make me a valuable asset to any company's managment team.</p>
            <h4 class="biotitle">A challenge I met head on...</h4>
            <p class="biopara">I launched a small business at the start of March 2020. I was able to build my business to $100k annual revenue. This experience has taught me to push my comfort zone, take action (and succeed) with skills I was learning on the fly, and to persevere through difficult times. </p><br>
            <p class="biopara">I continued to run my business as I took full time classes at General Assembly. I believe this showcases my ability to manage my time effectively, perform in high stress enviroments, and to multitask. I am looking forward to retiring my business when I begin my career in software engineering so that I can devot this dedication to my job.</p>
